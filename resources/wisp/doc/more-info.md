Wisp is a homoiconic JavaScript dialect with Clojure syntax, s-expressions and macros.

[Language essentials & documentation](./language-essentials.md).

Think of wisp as markdown for JavaScript programming, but with the added subtlety of LISP S-expressions, homoiconicity and powerful macros that make it the easiest way to write JavaScript.

*Why wouldn't I just use ClojureScript?*

For 99% of use-cases you probably should just use ClojureScript.

However, here are some niches that wisp might fill:

 * Compiles down to readable JavaScript.
 * No complicated stack or setup - contributors only need a browser.
 * Including it in a project can be as simple as a single `<script>` tag.
 * Close interop with native JavaScript - no `js/` prefix, uses JS types.
