# Wisp Compiler

This lets you compile [wisp](https://gozala.github.io/wisp/) forms (or strings) into Javascript

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/wisp-compiler.svg)](https://clojars.org/wisp-compiler)

## Why?
This allows you to embed Clojure-flavoured JavaScript into your [hiccup](http://weavejester.github.io/hiccup/), pages, e.g.:

```clojure
(hiccup/html
  [:div
    [:button {:onclick (wisp-compile (hello-world))} "Hello!"]
    [:script (wisp-compile
      (defn hello-world []
        (alert (str :Hello " World!"))))]])
```

which will compile into
```html
<div>
    <button onclick="helloWorld();">Hello!</button>
    <script>
        var helloWorld = function helloWorld() {
            return alert('' + 'Hello' + ' World!');
        };
    </script>
</div>
```

## Okay, but show me something useful
Compiling sexps into JavaScript is neat by itself, but sometimes you want to generate JavaScript dynamically on the server (e.g. for [Server-generated JavaScript Responses](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3697-server-generated-javascript-responses)). In this case you may have held your nose and just concatenated a bunch of strings. Here is a snippet from one of my projects (don't judge:)

```clj
(c/javascript-response (str "var newEl = document.createElement('span'); newEl.innerText = 'Upvoted!';"
                                "var el = document.getElementById(\"" commentid "\").querySelector(\"a.upvote\");"
                                "if(el) el.replaceWith(newEl);")
```

With wisp, this can be rewritten like this:
```clj
```






# Advanced usage
To use the more advanced wisp features, you'll need to include the runtime, the sequence and string libraries into the page. This should be possible by including the `resources/wisp/{runtime,sequence,string}.js` files into the page (in this order).

For caching reasons, you should probably just copy them into your `public` folder, but for convenience I am also exposing them as `wisp-runtime`, `wisp-sequence`, `wisp-string`, and altogether as `wisp-includes` functions that return these files as strings


# Compiling wisp
In the `resources/wisp` directory, run `make compiler` to re-compile the wisp compiler
